                            separators. A separator is defined as a period, one or
                            two underscores, or one or more hyphens. A component may
                            not start or end with a separator. While the OCI Distribution
                            Specification supports more than two slash-separated components,
                            most registries only support two slash-separated components.
                            For Docker’s public registry, the path format is as follows:
                            [NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY: The first, optional component
                            is typically a user’s or an organization’s namespace.
                            The second, mandatory component is the repository name.
                            When the namespace is not present, Docker uses library
                            as the default namespace.'
